ARM_disass
==========

This project will build an arm disassembler using a ruby script. The goal is to familiarize myself with the ARM instruction set.

After building the assembler, I plan to build an ISA emulator.

After building ISA emulator, I will create a C++ or verilog model for the ARM processor.
